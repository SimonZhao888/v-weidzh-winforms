# List of Diagnostics Produced by Windows Forms .NET APIs

## Obsoletions

Per https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/better-obsoletion/better-obsoletion.md and similar to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/list-of-diagnostics.md, we now have a strategy for marking existing APIs as `[Obsolete]`. This takes advantage of the new diagnostic id and URL template mechanisms introduced to `ObsoleteAttribute` in .NET 5.

The diagnostic id values reserved for obsoletions are `WFDEV001` through `WFDEV999`. When obsoleting an API, claim the next three-digit identifier in the `WFDEV###` sequence and add it to the list below. The URL template for all obsoletions is `https://aka.ms/winforms-warnings/{0}`. The `{0}` placeholder is replaced by the compiler with the `WFDEV###` identifier.

The acceptance criteria for adding an obsoletion includes:

* Add the obsoletion to the table below, claiming the next diagnostic id
    * Ensure the description is meaningful within the context of this table, and without requiring the context of the calling code
* Add new constants to `src\Common\src\Obsoletions.cs`, following the existing conventions
    * A `...Message` const using the same description added to the table below
    * A `...DiagnosticId` const for the `WFDEV###` id
* Annotate `src` files by referring to the constants defined from `Obsoletions.cs`
    * Specify the `UrlFormat = Obsoletions.SharedUrlFormat`
    * Example: `[Obsolete(Obsoletions.DomainUpDownAccessibleObjectMessage, DiagnosticId = Obsoletions.DomainUpDownAccessibleObjectDiagnosticId, UrlFormat = Obsoletions.SharedUrlFormat)]`
    * If the `Obsoletions` type is not available in the project, link it into the project
        * `<Compile Include="..\..\Common\src\Obsoletions.cs" Link="Common\Obsoletions.cs" />`
* Apply the `:book: documentation: breaking` label to the PR that introduces the obsoletion
* Follow up with the breaking change process to communicate and document the breaking change
    * In the breaking-change issue filed in [dotnet/docs](https://github.com/dotnet/docs), specifically mention that this breaking change is an obsoletion with a `WFDEV` diagnostic id
    * The documentation team will produce a PR that adds the obsoletion to the [WFDEV warnings](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/desktop/winforms/wfdev-diagnostics/obsoletions-overview) page
    * That PR will also add a new URL specific to this diagnostic ID; e.g. [WFDEV001](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/desktop/winforms/wfdev-diagnostics/wfdev001)
    * Connect with `@gewarren` or `@BillWagner` with any questions
* Register the `WFDEV###` URL in `aka.ms`
    * The vanity name will be `winforms-warnings/WFDEV###`
    * Ensure the link's group owner matches the group owner of `winforms-warnings/WFDEV001`
    * Connect with `@lonitra` or `@gewarren` with any questions
